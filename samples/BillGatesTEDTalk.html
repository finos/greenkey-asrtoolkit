<tr><td align="left">[15.86 - 19.99]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">i 'm going to talk today about energy and climate</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[19.99 - 34.89]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">and that might seem a bit surprising because my full time work at the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poorest two billion live better lives</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[34.89 - 44.72]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">but energy and climate are extremely important to these people in fact more important than to anyone else on the planet</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[44.72 - 53.30]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">the climate getting worse means that many years their crops won 't grow there will be too much rain not enough rain</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[53.73 - 67.27]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">things will change in ways that their fragile environment simply can 't support and that leads to starvation it leads to uncertainty it leads to unrest so the the climate changes will be terrible for them</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[67.27 - 81.83]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">also the price of energy is very important to them in fact if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of to reduce poverty by far you would pick energy now the price of energy has come down over time</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[81.83 - 91.34]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">uh really advanced civilization is based on advances in energy the coal revolution fueled</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[91.34 - 105.03]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">the industrial revolution and even in the nineteen hundreds we 've seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity and that 's why we have refrigerators air conditioning we can make uh modern materials and do so many things</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[105.03 - 111.67]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">and so we 're in a wonderful situation with uh electricity in the rich world</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[112.23 - 121.63]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">but as we make it cheaper and let 's say let 's go for making it twice as cheap we need to meet a new constraint</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[121.63 - 128.79]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">and that constraint has to do with co two co two is warming the planet</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[128.79 - 138.41]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">and the equation on co two is actually a very straightforward one if you sum up the co two that gets emitted</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[138.41 - 146.63]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">that leads to a temperature increase and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects the effects on the weather</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[146.63 - 156.25]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">and perhaps worse the indirect effects in that the natural ecosystems can 't adjust to these rapid changes and so you get ecosystem collapses</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[156.25 - 161.81]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">now the exact amount of how you map from a a certain increase of co two</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[161.81 - 173.45]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">to what temperature will be and where the positive feedbacks are there 's some uncertainty there but not very much and there 's certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be but they will be extremely bad</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[173.45 - 185.88]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">i asked the top scientists on this several times do we really have to get down to near zero can 't we just you know cut it in half or a quarter and the answer is that until we get near to zero</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[185.88 - 201.92]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">the temperature will continue to rise and so that 's that 's a big challenge it 's very different than saying you know we 're a twelve feet high truck trying to get under a ten feet bridge and we can just sort of squeeze under this is something that has to get to zero</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[202.72 - 210.13]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">now we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year over twenty six billion tons for each american</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[210.13 - 224.31]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">it 's about twenty tons uh for people in poor countries it 's less than one ton it 's an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet and somehow we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[224.31 - 239.17]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">it 's been constantly going up it 's only various economic changes that have even flattened it at all so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling and falling all the way to zero this equation has four factors</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[239.17 - 247.99]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">a little bit of multiplication so you 've got a thing on the left co two that you want to get to zero and that 's going to be based on the number of people</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[247.99 - 256.83]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">the services each person 's using on average the energy on average for each service and the co two being put out</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[256.83 - 268.06]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">per unit of energy so let 's look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero uh probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero now</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[268.06 - 275.05]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">and that 's back from high school algebra but let 's let 's take a look first we 've got population</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[275.05 - 285.43]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">now the world today has six point eight billion people that 's headed up to about nine billion now if we do a really great job on new vaccines health care</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[285.43 - 294.30]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">reproductive health services we could lower that by perhaps ten or fifteen percent but there we see an increase of about one point three</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[294.30 - 300.42]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">the second factor is the services we use this encompasses everything the food we eat</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[300.42 - 313.29]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">clothing tv heating these are very good things and getting rid of poverty means providing these services to almost everyone on the planet and it 's a great thing</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[313.29 - 321.16]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">for this number to go up in the rich world perhaps the top one billion we probably could cut back and use less but every year</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[321.16 - 329.91]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">this number on average is going to go up and so over all that will more than double the services delivered per person</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[329.91 - 340.92]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">here we have a very basic service do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework and in fact these kids don 't so they 're going out and reading their school work under the street lamps</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[342.38 - 353.02]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">now efficiency e the energy for each service here finally we have some good news we have something that 's not going up through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[353.02 - 364.88]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">through different types of cars different ways of building buildings there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite substantially</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[364.88 - 376.76]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">some individual services even bring it down by ninety percent there are other services like how we make fertilizer or how we do air transport where the rooms for improvement are far far less</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[376.76 - 386.54]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">and so overall here if we 're optimistic we may get a reduction of a a factor of three to even perhaps a factor of six</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[386.54 - 399.68]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">but for these first three factors now we 've gone from twenty six billion to at best maybe thirteen billion tons and that just won 't cut it so let 's look at this fourth factor this is going to be a key one</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[399.68 - 411.60]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">and this is the amount of co two put out per each unit of energy and so the question is can you actually get that to zero if you burn coal</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[411.60 - 426.26]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">no if you burn natural gas no almost every way we make electricity today except for the emerging renewables and nuclear puts out co two and so what we 're going to have to do at a global scale</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[426.26 - 435.00]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">is create a new system and so we need energy miracles now when i use the term miracle i don 't mean something that 's impossible</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[435.97 - 449.76]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">the microprocessor is a miracle the personal computer is a miracle the internet and its services are a miracle so the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles usually we don 't have a deadline</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[449.76 - 464.58]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">where you have to get the miracle by a certain date usually you just kind of stand by and some come along some don 't this is a case where we actually have to drive it full speed and get a miracle in a a pretty tight time line</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[464.58 - 475.10]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">now i thought how could i really capture this is there some kind of natural illustration some demonstration that would grab people 's imagination here</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[475.10 - 481.85]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">i thought back to a year ago when i brought mosquitos and somehow people enjoyed that</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[483.07 - 496.89]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">it it really got them involved in the idea of you know there are people who live with mosquitos so with energy all i could come up with is this i decided that releasing fireflies</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[496.89 - 508.93]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">would be my contribution to the environment here this year so here we have some natural fireflies i 'm told they don 't bite in fact they might not even not even leave that jar</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[510.81 - 522.22]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">now there 's all sorts gimmicky solutions like that one but they don 't really add up too much we need solutions either one or several that have</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[522.22 - 532.87]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">unbelievable scale and unbelievable reliability and although there 's many directions of people seeking i really only see five that</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[532.87 - 545.52]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">can achieve the big numbers i 've left out tide geothermal fusion biofuels those may make some contribution and if they can do better than i expect so much the better but my key point here</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[545.52 - 554.62]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">is that we 're going to have to work on each of these five and we can 't give up any of them because they they look daunting because they all</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[554.62 - 564.32]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">have significant challenges let 's look first at the burning fossil fuels either burning coal or burning natural gas what you need to do there</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[564.94 - 576.94]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">seems like it might be simple but it 's not and that 's to take all the co two after you 've burned it going out the flue pressurize it create a liquid put it somewhere and hope it stays there</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[576.94 - 590.39]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">now we have some pilot things that do this at the sixty to eighty percent level but getting up to that full percentage that will be very tricky and agreeing on where these co two quantities should be put</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[590.39 - 597.17]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">will be hard but the toughest one here is this long term issue who 's going to be sure who 's going to guarantee</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[597.17 - 607.24]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in in terms of nuclear or other things this is a lot of volume</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[607.24 - 618.01]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">so that 's a tough one next would be nuclear it also has three big problems cost particularly in highly regulated countries is high</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[618.01 - 626.63]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">the issue of the safety really feeling good about nothing could go wrong that even though you have these human operators that the fuel</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[626.63 - 641.82]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">doesn 't get used for weapons and then what do you do with the waste and although it 's not very large there are a lot of concerns about that people need to feel good about it so three very tough problems that might be solvable and so should be worked on</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[641.82 - 650.29]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">the last three of the five i 've grouped together these are what people often refer to as the renewable sources and they actually</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[650.29 - 658.02]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">although it 's great they don 't require fuel they have some disadvantages one is that the density</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[658.02 - 664.89]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">of energy gathered in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant this is energy farming</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[664.89 - 676.66]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">so you 're talking about many square miles thousands of time more area than than you think of as a normal energy plant also these are intermittent sources the sun doesn 't shine</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[676.66 - 683.50]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">all day it doesn 't shine every day and likewise the wind doesn 't blow all the time and so if you depend on these sources</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[683.50 - 692.11]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time periods that it 's not available so we 've got big cost challenges here</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[692.11 - 706.65]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">we have transmission challenges for example say this energy source is outside your country you not only need the technology but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere and finally this storage problem</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[706.65 - 718.08]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">and to dimensionalize this i went through and looked at all the types of batteries that get made for cars for computers for phones for flashlights for everything and compared that</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[718.08 - 727.17]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">to the amount of electrical energy the world uses and what i found is that all the batteries we make now could store less than ten minutes</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[727.17 - 734.09]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">of all the energy and so in fact we need a big breakthrough here something that 's going to be</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[734.09 - 748.85]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">a factor of a hundred better than the approaches we have now it 's not it 's not impossible but it 's not a very easy thing now this shows up when you try to get the the intermittent source to be above say twenty to thirty percent</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[748.85 - 757.17]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">of what you 're using if you 're counting on it for a hundred percent you need a an incredible miracle battery</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[757.17 - 766.73]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">now how we 're going to go forward on this what 's what 's the right approach is it a manhattan project what 's the the thing that can get us there well we need lots</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[766.73 - 777.44]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">of companies working on this hundreds in each of these five paths we need at least a hundred people and a lot of them you 'll look at and say they 're crazy that 's good</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[777.44 - 784.66]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">and i think here in the ted group we have many people who are already pursuing this</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[784.66 - 803.89]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">bill gross has several companies including one called esolar that has some great solar thermal technologies vinod khosla 's investing in dozens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities and i 'm i 'm trying to help back that nathan myhrvold and i actually are backing a company</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[803.89 - 811.93]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">that perhaps surprisingly is actually taking the nuclear approach there are some innovations in nuclear modular liquid</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[811.93 - 823.39]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">and innovation really stopped in this industry quite some time ago so the idea that there 's some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising the idea of terrapower</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[823.39 - 833.04]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">is that instead of burning a part of uranium the one percent which is the u two thirty five we decided let 's burn the ninety nine percent</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[833.04 - 840.18]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">the u two thirty eight it is kind of a crazy idea in fact people had talked about it for a long time</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[840.18 - 850.31]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not and so it 's through the advent of modern supercomputers that now you can simulate and see that yes with the right</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[850.31 - 858.94]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">material 's approach this looks like it would work and because you 're burning that ninety nine percent you have</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[858.94 - 873.60]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">greatly improved cost profile you actually burn up the waste and you can actually use as fuel all the leftover waste from today 's reactors so instead of worrying about them you just take that it 's a great thing</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[873.60 - 883.84]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">it breathes this uranium as it goes along so it 's kind of like a candle you can see it 's it 's a log there often referred to as a traveling wave reactor in terms of fuel</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[883.84 - 896.91]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">this really solves the problem i 've got a picture here of a place in kentucky this is the left over the ninety nine percent where they 've taken out the part they burn now so it 's called depleted uranium that would power the u s</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">[917.81 - 932.70]</td><td align="left">BillGates</td><td align="left">so let 's think how should we measure ourselves what should our report card look like well let 's go out to where we really need to get and and then look at the intermediate for twenty fifty you 've heard many people talk about</td></tr>
