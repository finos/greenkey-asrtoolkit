<unk> s asia that
uh
i'm going to talk today about
energy and climate
and that might seem a bit surprising because my full time work of the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds about the things that we need to invent and deliver
to help the poorest two billion live better lives
but energy and climate are extremely important to these people in fact more important than to anyone else on the planet the climate getting worse
means that many years their crops won't grohl they'll be too much rain not enough rain things will change in ways that their fragile environment simply can't support
and that leads to starvation leads done certainty at leeds unrest
as for the climate changes will be terrible for them
also the price of energy is very important to them in fact if you could pick just one thing the lower the price up to reduce poverty by fire you would pick energy
now the price of energy has come down over time
really advanced civilization
i was based on advances in in energy the coal revolution dueled the industrial revolution and even in the nineteen hundreds we've seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity
and that's why we have refrigerator air conditioning we can make modern materials and do so many things
and so we're in a wonderful situation with l precisely in the rich world
but as we make a cheaper and love tailored to go for making a de twice as t
we need to mean the new constraint
and that constraint has to do with c o two seal too
is warming the planet and the equation on c o two is actually a very straightforward one if you sum up the c o two that gets emitted
that leads to a temperature increase and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects
the effects on the weather perhaps worse the indirect effects in that the natural legal systems can't adjust to these rapid changes and so you get ecosystem collapses
now the exact amount of how you map from a certain increase in of c o two to what temperature will be in where the positive feedbacks are there is some uncertainty there but not very much
and there are certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be but they will be extremely bad
i asked the top scientists on the several times do we really have to get down to near zero can't we just cut it in half or a quarter and the answer is that until we get near to zero
the temperature will continue to rise until that's that's a big challenge is very different than seen you know were twelve foot high truck trying to get under a ten foot bridge and we can just sort of
squeeze under this is something that has to get to zero
now we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year now over twenty six billion tons on for each american it's about twenty tons
our for people in poor countries have less on one time to now raging about five times for everyone on the planet and somehow we have to make changes
that will bring that down to zero
it's been constantly going up it's only various economic changes that have even flattened at all so we have to go from rapidly rising to follow him and falling all the way to zero
this equation has four packers a little bit of mortification so got it thing on the left c o two that we want to get to zero and that's going to be based on the number of people
the services each person using unite average
the energy on average free service and the c o two being put out
our per unit of energy so let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero
how's that
back from high school algebra but let's let's take a look
firstly got population of the world today has six point eight billion people that headed up to about nine billion
now if we do a really great job on new vaccines healthcare reproductive health services we could lower that by perhaps ten or fifteen percent but there we see an increase of about one point three
the second factor is the services we use this encompasses everything the food we clothing t v heating these are very good things
uh getting rid of poverty means providing these services to almost everyone on the planet in a to greet thing for this number to go up in the rich world perhaps the top one billion we probably could cut back and use less
but every year this number on average just waiting to go up
and so overall that will more than double the services delivered per person
here we have a very basic service do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework and in fact these kids don't to they're going out and reading their schoolwork under the street laughs
now efficiency e the energy for each service here finally we have some good news we have something that's not going up
through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting through different types of cars
are different ways the building buildings there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite substantially some individual services even bring it down by nine percent
there are other services like how we make for lies or how we do air transport where the rooms for improvement are far far less
and so overall here if we're optimistic we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even perhaps a factor of s**
but police for three factors now we've gone from twenty six billion to at best maybe thirteen billion tons and that just won't cut it
so we are told that this fourth factor there's going to be a key one and this is the amount of c o two put out for each unit of energy and so the question is can you actually get back to zero
if you burn coal no few burn natural gas in almost every way we make electricity today except for the emerging renewables and nuclear puts out c o two
and so we're going to have to do at a global scale
is create a new system until we need energy miracles
now when i use the term miracle i don't mean something that's impossible
you know they the microprocessor as a miracle the personal computers a miracle the inner net net services or a miracle so the people here participated in the creation of many miracles
usually we don't have a deadline where you have to get the miracle by a certain date usually just kind of stand by and some kind along some don't this is a case
where we actually have to drive at full speed and get a miracle in a a pretty tight timeline
now i thought how could i really capture this is there some kind of napper little in some demonstration that would grab people's imagination here
i thought back to a year ago when i brought mosquitoes
and somehow at people enjoyed that it really got them involved in the idea you know there are people liberal mosquitoes so with energy
i like could come up with is this i decided that releasing fireflies would be my contribution to the environment could have this year so here we ever
something after firefighters and pulled the non bite in fact in might even not even leave that jar laughter
now there's all sorts of gimmicky solutions like that one but they don't really add up to much we need
solutions either one or several that have
unbelievable scale and unbelievable reliability
and although there as many directions or people seeking
i really only see five that can achieve the big numbers have left out type deal thermal fusion by appeals those may make some contribution in a vacant knew better than i expect so much the better
but my key point here
his book with warning we have to work on each of these five and we can't give up any of them because they they look daunting because they all have significant challenges
i'll let 's look first at their burning fossil fuels see they're burning coal and burning natural gas
what you need to do there yeah seems like it might be simple but it's not and that's for t all of the c o two after you burn it going out the flu pressurise it cradle liquid put it somewhere and hope it stays there
now we have some pilot things that do this at the sixty to eighty percent level but getting up to that four percentage that will be very tricky and a green on where these co two quantity should be put
will be hired but dr first one here is this long term issue who's going to be sure who's going to guarantee
as something that is literally billions of times larger than any paper of waste do think i've been in terms of nuclear other things this is a lot
a volume
so that's a tough one
next would be nuclear
it also has three big problems highest particularly in highly regulated countries is high the issue of the safety really dealing good about nothing can go wrong that he'd been out you have these human operators
that the fuel doesn't get used for weapons
and then we're what do you do with the waste although it's not very large other a lot of concerns about that people need to feel good about it so three very tough problems that might be a solvable and so should be worked on
the white house three of the five i grouped together these are what people often referred to as the renewable sources
and they actually all loads rate date on quail fuel they have some disadvantages one is that the density
and the energy gather in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant this is energy farming so you're talking about many square miles thousands of times more area then they new think others are normal energy plant
of these are interment and sources the sun doesn't shine
all day doesn't shine every day and likewise the wind doesn't blow all the time and so have you depend on the sources you have to have some way of getting energy dream those time periods
that is not available
so we have got big cast challenges here
we have transmission challenges for example say this energy sources outside your country not only need d. technology but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere and finally this storage problem
ended the marginalized this i went through and looked at all the types of batteries that get made for choirs for computers for farms for flashlights for everything
and compare that to the amount of a look more energy the world users and what i found is that all the batteries we make now
fed store less than ten minutes of all the energy
until then per hour we need a big breakthrough here something that's going to be our packer of a hundred better than the approaches we have now it's not it's not impossible but it's not a very easy thing
now this shows up when you try to get the the internet and soars to be a bob say twenty to thirty percent of what you're using if you're counting on it for a hundred percent you need a an incredible
miracle battery
now how we're going to go forward on this what's what's the right approach is that the manhattan project quotes the the thing that can get us there while we need lots of companies are working on this
hundreds in each of these by powers we need at least a hundred people and a lot of them you'll look at and say they're crazy that's good
n i think here in the ted group we have many people who are already pursuing this bill gross has several companies include one called e solar that has great solar thermal technology
an old paul invest investing in dozens of companies that are doing greetings and have interesting possibilities and am trying to help back that
i need the miracle than i actually are backing a company that perhaps surprisingly is actually taking the nuclear product
and there are some innovations in nuclear modular liquid and innovation really stopped in this industry quite some time and goes to the idea that there is some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising
the idea of terror power
is that instead of burning third part of uranium the one percent that's that you two thirty five we decided well let's burn the ninety nine percent the u two three eight
it 's kind of a crazy idea and back people had talked about it for a long time
but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not until it's through the advent of modern supercomputers that now you can simulate and see that yes with the right materials approach this looks like it would work
n because you're burning that ninety nine percent
you have greatly improved cast up profile you actually burn up the waste and you can actually use as fuel
all the leftover waste from today's reactors and so instead of worrying about them you just take that it's a great thing
it breeds this uranium as it goes along so it's kind of like the candle in suits it's a log there are often referred to as the traveling wave reactor
in terms of fuel
this really solves the problem i have got a picture here have a place in kentucky this is the left over of the ninety nine percent where they've taken out the party bernau now so have called depleted uranium that would power the u s for hundreds of years
and simply by filtering seawater in an inexpensive process you don't have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet
so you know it's got lots lots of challenges ahead but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward
so we're turning couch we measure ourselves what should our report card our work like
well let's go out to where we really need to get in and then looked at the intermediate for twenty fifty you've heard many people talk about this eighty percent reduction
that really is very important that we get there and that twenty percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries still some agriculture hopefully we will have cleaned up forests free cement
so to get to that eighty percent
the developed countries
including countries like china will have had the switch their electronic electricity generation all together
so the other great is are we deploying this zero emission technology
have we deployed in all the developed countries and we're in the process of getting that elsewhere that's super important at a key element of making
that report card
so backing up from there lectured the twenty twenty report card look like
well it again it should have the two elements we should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions the less we emit the last that some will be of c o two and therefore the last the temperature but in some ways the grade we get there
doing things that don't get us all the way to the big redactions is only equally or maybe even slightly less important than the other
which is the piece of innovation on these breakthroughs these breakthroughs we need to move those at full speed and we can measure that in terms of companies pilot projects regulatory things that have been chain
there 's a lot of great books that have been written about this the al gore book our choice and the david mci book sustainable energy without the hot air they really go through it and i think can great a framework
that this can be discussed broadly because we need brian backing for this
there was a lot has to come together so this is a wish it's a very concrete wish that we invent this technology if you gave me only one wish for the next fifty years i can pickles president
i can pick the vaccine which was something i love or a could pick that this thing that's half the class with knoll c o two gifts invented
this is the wish i would pick
this is the one with the greatest impact
if we don't get this wish that division between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible between the u s and china between poor countries that rich and most of all the lives of those two billion will be far worse
so what do we have to do what am i appealing to you too as step forward and
and drive we need to go from war research funding
one countries get gather at places like copenhagen leishan just discuss the c o two they should discuss this innovation agenda and you'd be stand up the ridiculously low levels of spending on these innovative approaches
we do need the market and sadness c o two tax cap and trade something that gets out price signal out there we need to get the message out we need to have this style of be a more rational more understandable dialogue including the steps of the government takes
this is unimportant wish but it is one i think we can achieve
thank you
<unk>
uh you <unk>
um
thank you um stutter and the far more about about the terror paler right first of will give a sense what to the scale of investment that is
well do
he actually do this software by the supercomputer higher all the great scientists which we done that's only tens of millions and even once we test our materials out in a rush from reactor to make sure that our materials work
properly then you'll only be up and hundreds of millions the touching is building the pilot reactor finding the several billion finding the regulator that location that will actually build the first one of these once you get the first one built
if it works as advertised then it as clear as day because the economics the energy density are so different than nuclear as we know it and said to understand it right this involves
building deep into the ground on the slack like a vertical kind of column of nuclear
the all of the fittest of spent uranium
and then and then and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down that's reg to d you're always refueling react sea of of people in large controls that can go wrong thing we are all it up and moving things in and out that
that's not good so if you have very very cheap fuel then you can put sixty years in just think of it as a log
put it down and not have those same complexities and it just sits there and burns to the sixty years
r n and then it's start it's it's a nuclear power plant is zone waste disposal solution yeah well what happens with the week you can
you can let it sit there there's a lot less waste under this approach
then you can actually peak that and put it into another one and berm that
and we started out actually by taking the waste that exists today that sitting in these cooling pools are dried casting by reactors that's our fuel to begin with so the thing that's been a problem from those reactors is actually
but gets that into ours and your reducing the volume of the waste quite dramatically as you're going through this process
i mean you're talking to different people around the world about the possibilities here whereas there most interesting actually doing something with this
well we haven't picked a particular place but
and there's all these interesting disclosure rules about anything it's called nuclear so we've got a lot of interest of the people from the company have been rushing india china i've been back seen the secretary of energy
<unk> are talking about how this
fits end of the energy agenda so i'm optimistic the french and japanese have done some work this is a variant on something that has been done it's an important
advanced but it's like a fast reactor in a lot of countries have built on so anybody who's done fast reactor is a candidate to to be where the first one gets built so in in your mind um
timescale unlikelihood of actually taking certain like this slide
what we mean
for one of these high scale electorate elect generation things that's very cheap
we have twenty years to invent and then twenty years to deploy that's sort of the deadline that the buyer models environmental models of have shown us that we have to meet
and terror power if things go well which is wishing for a lot could easily meet that
and there are fortunately now dozens of companies we need to be hundreds who likewise if their science goes well with the funding for their plant pilot plans goes well that they they can compete for this
and it's best at multiple succeed because then you could use a mix
a mix of these things we certainly need one to succeed
then in terms of big scale possible game changes this is the biggest that your aware about there
and energy breakthrough is the the most important thing it would have been even without the environmental constraints of the environmental comes straight just makes it so much so much greater in the nuclear space there are other innovators
are we don't know their work as well as we know this one but the modular people that's a different approach there's a liquid type reactor which seems a little hard
but maybe they say about us in so there there are different ones but the beauty of this is a molecule uranium has a million times as much energy
as a molecule of say call
and so if you can deal with the negatives which essentially the relation the footprint in class the potential in terms of effect on land and various things is
in almost any class at the song
if this doesn't work
then what do we have to start taking emergency measures to try and keep the temperature of the earth stable yeah if you get into that situation it's like
if you're he been overeating in you're about to have a heart attack you know then then then where do you go you may need heart surgery or something there is a line of research on what's called geo engineering
which are various techniques that would delay the heating
tobias twenty or thirty years to get our act together now you hope that's just an insurance policy you hope you don't need to do that
some people say you shouldn't even work on the insurance policy because it might make you lazy that you'll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you i'm not sure that's wise given the importance of the problem but
there's now that the geo engineering discussion about should that be in the back pocket
in case things happen thousand or this innovation goes a lot slower than we expect
climate skeptics if you had them a sentence for two to say to them how how might you persuade them that they're wrong
well unfortunately the skeptics come in different camps i mean the ones who
make scientific arguments are very few you know are they saying that there's negative feedback effects have to do a clouds that off sat things they're beery very few things
that they can even say you know there's a chance at a million of those things
the main problem you have here it's kind of like aes you make them a state now and you pay for it a lot later
and so when you have all sorts of urgent problems the idea of taking paying now that has to do the gain later in a somewhat uncertain painting in fact the i.p.c.c. report you know that
that not necessarily the worst keys and there are people in the ritual to look at i.p.c.c. and say okay you know that that isn't that big a deal the fact is it's that uncertain part
that should move us toward says but my dreams year is that if you can make it economic
and me the co two constraint then the skeptics say okay i don't care that it doesn't put out here too i kind of wish did without here too but i guess i'll accept it because it's cheaper that right what's come before
and so
and so that would be a response to the bjorn lomborg argument that basically a few if you spend all this energy trying to sell the c o two problem
it 's going to take away all your other goals trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and therefore that it's a stupid waste of the earth's resources to put money towards that when they're better things we can do yet more the actual spending non the r. and d. s
you know say the u s and spend ten billion year more than it is right now it's not that dramatic it shouldn't take away from other things the thing you get into big money on and this reasonable people can disagree is when you have some its noneconomic
and you're trying to fund that that to me mostly his waste unless you're very close and you're just funding the learning curve and it's going to get very cheap
i believe we should tray more things that have the potential to be far less expensive if the trade off you get into his let's make energy suprun super expensive
then the rich can afford that mean all of us here could pay five times as much for energy and not change our lifestyle the disaster is for that two billion and even lomborg cows changed his stick now is
why isn't the r. and d. getting more discussed he he still because it is earlier stuff sort of associated with the skeptic camp but
he is realized that that's a pretty lonely cap and and so he's making the r. and d. point and solar is the threat of something that
i think is appropriate the r. and d. peace it's crazy how little it fund
while built i suspect i speak on behalf of most people here to say i really hope your wish comes true thank you so much thank you <unk>
uh
uh <unk>
the just change have the race day one as and on the change that some to ted that it had the <unk>
using find solutions the <unk>
<unk>
the what
the is that s
the ring
the people are playing with words and it's true all week long people have
putting words together and very unique ways i've been thinking about how food and wine are bared by experts really understand the flavors in here at ted people are putting <unk>
words together in my hairs because they understand the <unk>
meaning reckless creativity what i married that is just thinking about words that don't go together we're one and one equal three if that's what ted's all about isn't as
putting things together we don't normally
